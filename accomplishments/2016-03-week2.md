### Week in Review
This week was incredible. 

I started this repo, which, after previously using google keep and note taking after each day, this allows a clear, defined, status for each week. Super nice! Quite a few of my team members were out sick this week, which really helped me understand their systems and how to develop quickly. I received some high notes from my supervisor about asking around and not waiting for him and to keep it up. Also, suggestions during Sprint Planning are heard (SQL query is blocked) and to incorporate sick days with Sprint Demo email because of the number of outages and effect on the sprint.

I'm ready to move to the next level.
