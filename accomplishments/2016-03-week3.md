### Week in Review
This week was busy! Migrating from Git to SVN took much longer than we thought.. Migrating branches wasn't as useful because they still needed to be re-based off master. Long story short, any dev work previous done in a branch that wasn't in prod, needed to be re-coded.

Created quarterly objectives and reviewed prior objectives. Productivity (+25% more work), learn Angular (or other MV*) and present how we use it in our project currently (get everyone up to date), and write VS Unit Tests for production issues that arise (gotta start somewhere)
