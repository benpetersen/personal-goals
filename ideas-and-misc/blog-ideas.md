Blog Ideas and Steps to complete

##Update Blog Post on Importance of Agile-ish Teams

1. Process of Sprint POC (Sprint commit emails, Run release on release day, Start demo check-in)
2. Responsibility is rotated amongst Developers on team, always a different POC and Backup POC.
3. Why is this awesome? (Share responsiblity, team work, and you get to do it! Many teams, team leads take this responsibility and don't share)


##Experiencing new Things
1. Be able to disconnect, enjoy my time off
2. Go do something different (our favorites so far have been a Musical, Opera, Distillery Tour)
	- Don't be afraid of spending a little money, if it goes a long way. (Looking forward to something that you'll remember)
	- What don't you (and your partner?) normally do. 
	- Stretch yourself! Be out of your comfort zone!
	- Learn something new (culture, why your friend enjoys an activity)
	- Enjoy yourself.
